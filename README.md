# NYC TAXIS & WEATHER

This repository includes:

- An exploratory analysis of a dataset with taxi trips in NYC
- An automated PostgreSQL Data Warehouse with Airflow
- A web app to query the database
- A machine learning model to predict the fare amount per distance of a trip
- A dashboard in Power Bi with metrics to make better decisions when investing in a taxi unit

## Overview

A passenger transport service company that is currently operating in the medium and long-distance bus sector is interested in investing in the passenger car transport sector.

Since it would be a new business unit, it is intended to make an analysis of the movement of taxis in the city of New York, in order to obtain a reference and be able to make well-founded decisions.

The objective is to accompany the business in this decision-making process, for which the data provided (2018/01 yellow taxi trip records) will be collected.
